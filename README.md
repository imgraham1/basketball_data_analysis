# basketball_data_analysis

The purpose of this project was to explore 10 years worth of college basketball data to try and gain insight on what characteristics may be important in determining a team's winning peercentage.

For this project, I use data from the popular KenPom website. This site has some of the best college basketball rankings and statistics around and is widely referenced - especially before the NCAA March Madness tournament.

In the Rmd file I first do some exploratory data exploration to get a better sense of the data and to uncover any initial interesting findings. After the EDA, I used clustering techniques to see if there are any clear groups of temas that separate themselves from the rest.
